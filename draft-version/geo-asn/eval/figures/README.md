# Figures created by the evaluation

### Number of nodes over time, distinguished by all and reachable nodes

File ```num_nodes.png/.tex```.
X-axis depicts time stamps, y-axis the number of nodes.

### Log-log degree distributions of a specific crawl (default: first), distinguished by all and reachable nodes

Files ```log_all_nodes_degree_distribution.png/.tex``` and ```log_online_nodes_degree_distribution.png/.tex```.
X-axis relative frequencies, y-axis degree. Typical layout for a degree distribution plot, shows how many nodes there are in the graph with a certain degree.
Logarithmic axis to see, if the degree distribution can be approximated by a power-law (straight line), implying a scale-free graph.

### Agent version distribution

File ```agent_version_distribution.png/.tex```.
Distribution of agent versions as pie chart. Focuses on the top 10 most used agent versions.
