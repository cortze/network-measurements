# P2P Observatory 

## Motivation & Vision

Public, user-run, permissionless networksâ€™ dynamics are rather unpredictable due to the multiple types of applications and services that leverage them. Because they are not owned by a single user, analysing their behavior needs to be done through (non-invasive) proxies and probes, rather than through (invasive) controls (analogous to how one measures and observes patterns in a brain). Because of this hard challenge, most P2P networks put observability as a secondary goal.

In order to promote a healthy ecosystem of protocol developers where hypotheses are tested and verified through real world measurements, we envisioned the P2P Networks Observatory,  a project focused on measuring all kinds of Public P2P Networks. We believe that having the ability to get information from the real-time performance of the network can help tremendously in both real-time decision-making (e.g., request routing and forwarding) and in long-term protocol design (e.g., best ways to populate routing tables).

[RFMs](docs/RFMs.md) containts the proposals for measurements that will be implemented as part of the P2P observatory.
